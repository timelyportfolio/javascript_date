## Some R `xts` in javascript

This all started when I was looking for something in javascript like `endpoints` from the
R package `xts`.  I will admit that I abandoned my search rather quickly, since I thought 
recreating it would be an interesting challenge.

I'll use this repo as a collection of knowledge, function, and examples for dates in javascript.
